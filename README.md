# 🎮 Connect four with C++
This is a CLI, 2-player connect four game implemented in C++ for practice reasons.
### 🛠 Requirements & instructions 🚀 to run it:
1. Download a C++ compiler.

2. Extract the downloaded file.
3. Locate the bin folder and add it to **PATH** environemnt variables.

4. Open terminal then run:
    ```bash
    g++ ConnectFour.cpp -o ConnectFour.exe
    ```
And voila, there you have it (game's executable) in the folder where you cloned this repo.

5. To run it, in terminal run:
    ```bash
    ./ConnectFour.exe
    ``` 
    or use the one liner to compile and run at the same time: 
    ```bash
    g++ program.cpp -o program.exe && ./program.exe
    ```
Feel free to contribute/ suggest any improvements to my simple game.

### Future Plan:
    Learn more about algorithms and AI to improve the bot's playing strength(for now as a challenge try to lose against it)

Thank you!!!!!
